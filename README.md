# HTTPPoster
A little library to easily HTTP POST variables &amp; files in Android.

This code is an merge of [this Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19188010) and [this solution](http://www.xyzws.com/javafaq/how-to-use-httpurlconnection-post-data-to-web-server/139) put in a nice AsyncTask, with configuration and a listener for all events.

It is also updated to the newest Android API, as HttpPost and HttpClient classes are deprecated in favor of HttpURLConnection.

This tiny library is composed of 3 classes:
- [HttpListener](https://github.com/licryle/HTTPPoster/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/licryle/httpposter/HttpListener.java) - An interface you need to implement to listen for callbacks.
- [HttpConfiguration](https://github.com/licryle/HTTPPoster/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/licryle/httpposter/HttpConfiguration.java) - A helper class holding the configuration &amp; content of the HTTP POST Request to execute. 
- [HttpPoster](https://github.com/licryle/HTTPPoster/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/licryle/httpposter/HttpPoster.java) - The main class - the ASyncTask that will execute the POST requets based on the given [HttpConfiguration](https://github.com/licryle/HTTPPoster/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/licryle/httpposter/HttpConfiguration.java), sending back signals through the [HttpListener](https://github.com/licryle/HTTPPoster/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/licryle/httpposter/HttpListener.java).

# How to use?
## Android Studio Setup
In your Android Studio project, create a folder called libs, for example: ./AndroidStudioProject/MyProject/libs

Download the repository files and unpack either:
* At the root of ./AndroidStudioProjects/ then create a symbolic link from ./AndroidStudioProject/MyProject/libs/HTTPPoster to ./AndroidStudioProject/HTTPPoster/library
* The directory "library" into the ./AndroidStudioProject/MyProject/libs/ directory and rename the "library" folder to "HTTPPoster"


In your settings.gradle *Project file*, add the following:

```include ':libs:HTTPPoster'```

In your build.gradle *Module file* (usually "app"), add the dependency:

```
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation project(':libs:HTTPPoster')
}
```

## Quick usage
```
import java.io.File;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;

import com.licryle.httpposter.HttpConfiguration;
import com.licryle.httpposter.HttpPoster;
...
HashMap<String, String> mArgs = new HashMap<>();
mArgs.put("lat", "40.712784");
mArgs.put("lon", "-74.005941");

ArrayList<File> aFileList = getMyImageFiles();

URL mEndPoint = new URL("http://www.mysite.com/HttpPostEndPoint");

HttpConfiguration mConf = new HttpConfiguration(
        mEndPoint,
        mArgs,
        aFileList,
        this,  // If this class implements HttpListener
        null,   // Boundary for Entities - Optional
        15000,  // Timeout in ms for the connection operation
        10000   // Timeout in ms for the reading operation
);

new HttpPoster().execute(mConf);
```
